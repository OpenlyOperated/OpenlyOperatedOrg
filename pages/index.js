              to everything? Privacy policies are often copy-pasted and
              meaningless without proof, and there's nobody checking if the
              company is actually following them. By the time the public finds

            <p>
              Apps should <em>earn</em> user trust by operating with full
              transparency, leaving no room for questionable or lazy behavior.
              This isn't just open sourcing a few parts of an app â€” it's giving
              the public a read-only account to the app's servers and
              infrastructure, allowing anyone to verify the app's privacy and
              security claims. To ensure that the transparency is consistent,
              reliable, and comprehensive, we created a certification for
              products to provide verifiable proof of their claims:{" "}

            <p>
              Privacy and security scandals happen every week not because
              companies are evil, but because companies operate on incentives.
              In a world where there's no way to verify an app's security or
              privacy claims, why should a company be honest and make less
              money, when their competitors are being dishonest and making more
              money? Current incentives give dishonest and insecure companies an
              edge to grow faster, compete more efficiently, spend more on
              marketing, and capture the most customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Openly Operated provides a structured way for companies to prove
              their honesty. It's comprehensive, verifiable, and is the long
              term solution to fix the status quo's perverse incentives.
