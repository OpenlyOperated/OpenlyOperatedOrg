              Currently, the Openly Operated auditors consist of a handful of
              engineers that are familiar with the Openly Operated requirements,
              but we'll soon open it up to anyone who wants to audit, and we're
              now working out the best way to onboard new auditors and helping
              them through their initial audits.{" "}

              Once an auditor is matched with a product and its Audit Kit and
              Audit Template, the Openly Operated audit process begins:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-serif">
              <li>
                <strong>Receive and Accept OpenAudit Request -</strong> The
                auditor receives a request for audit on the OpenAudit platform,
                and then accept it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Verify OpenAudit References -</strong> Each OpenAudit
                document contains references that must be verified. The auditor
                opens the document in "Audit" mode, and verifies each reference
                to make sure it sufficiently and accurately backs the claim.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mark Audit as Complete -</strong> Once all references
                have been verified, the auditor marks the audit as complete.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Receive Payment -</strong> The administrators of the
                OpenAudit platform do final checks on the document, and then
                release payment to the auditor.
              </li>

              Auditors play a very large role in the future of the internet. As
              more apps and services become open to improve privacy and
              security, their complex inner workings will require more dedicated
              specialists to both help find issues and increase public
              understanding in them. Technology companies today have both the
              responsibility and the resources to ensure every part of their
              products are properly and publicly audited.
